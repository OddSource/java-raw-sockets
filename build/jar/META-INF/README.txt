NOTES
=====

On most operating systems, you must have root access or administrative
privileges to use raw sockets. Many people have reported issues using any
Java raw socket utilities on Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008.
Other operating systems should support this library.

This library can easily be extended to support enhanced functionality. We
encourage developers who do so to contribute their work back to the project
so that everyone can benefit, but you are not required to do so.
