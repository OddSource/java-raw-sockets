/**
 * Specifies a strict interface and behavioral contract for all packet objects. The behavior defined in the comments
 * for each method should be adhered to strictly to fulfill this contract. More generally, the following rule should
 * be observed when any new mutator (setter) methods are added in any future implementations:<br />
 * <br />
 * If {@link #finalizePacket()} has previously been called, a {@link FinalizedPacketException} must be thrown. The
 * only exception to this is {@link #setSourceAddress(InetAddress)}, which should only throw this exception for
 * {@link Packet.Source#INCOMING} packets that have been finalized.<br />
 * <br />
 * The default hop limit (IPv6) or time-to-live/TTL (IPv4) should be {@link #DEFAULT_HOP_LIMIT} if not otherwise
 * specified.
